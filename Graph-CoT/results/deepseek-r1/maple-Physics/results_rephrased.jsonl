It argues that the Froissart bound, derived in QCD's chiral limit (ignoring pion mass), cannot explain experimentally observed slow growth due to the non-negligible pion mass. The paper critiques the bound's applicability at current energy scales (below 10^5-10^6 GeV), highlighting that while the Froissart-Martin bound imposes theoretical constraints, these become relevant only at unattainably high energies. Key references discuss debates around gluon saturation, unitarization, and alternative QCD-based explanations, contextualizing the paper's conclusion that pion mass limits the bound's practical relevance.", "duration": 50.48, "token_count": 37457, "api_calls": 16, "gt_answer": "N/A"}
