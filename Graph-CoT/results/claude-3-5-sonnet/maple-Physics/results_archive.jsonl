By analysing the local stability of the system, we reveal two different mechanisms leading to self-oscillations. Contrary to many previously studied optomechanical systems, self-oscillations of torsional meta-molecules can be extremely robust against mechanical damping due to the chiral nature of the structure. A consequence of self-oscillations in this system is dynamic nonlinear optical activity, which can be actively controlled by a range of parameters such as the field strength and polarization of the incident wave.\"This research focuses on the nonlinear dynamics of torsional metamaterials, specifically investigating self-oscillations in these structures and their potential applications in dynamic nonlinear optical activity.", "duration": 37.09, "token_count": 25581, "api_calls": 14, "gt_answer": "N/A"}

It describes a three-step process for neutrino oscillations, involving maximal atmospheric mixing, maximal solar neutrino mixing, and finally, large solar neutrino mixing induced by mass term rotations. The model incorporates standard Higgs scalars, a singly charged scalar, and an extra triplet Higgs scalar to achieve these results.", "duration": 40.31, "token_count": 26338, "api_calls": 14, "gt_answer": "N/A"}

This approach simplifies calculations, reduces the operator basis, and clarifies several theoretical aspects of NRQCD, including the role of soft ghosts and color structures in the static potential.

It was authored by Kostas Skenderis and Adam Bzowski. The paper addresses recent interest in the relationship between scale invariance and conformal invariance in four-dimensional unitary quantum field theories. The authors present a complete analysis of possible scale anomalies in correlation functions of the trace of the stress-energy tensor in these theories.Key findings of the paper include:1. 2, 3, and 4-point functions exhibit non-trivial anomalies.2. Connected higher-point functions are non-anomalous.3. Special attention is given to semi-local contributions to correlators (terms with support on sets containing both coincident and separated points).4. The anomalies in 3 and 4-point functions can be accounted for by semi-local contributions.The paper discusses the implications of these results for the ongoing debate about scale versus conformal invariance in quantum field theories.

The paper revisits the hedgehog ansatz for spherically symmetric spacetimes in self-gravitating nonlinear sigma models and Skyrme models, and proposes its generalization for non-spherically symmetric spacetimes. The key idea is that even when matter fields depend on Killing coordinates in a non-trivial way, the corresponding energy-momentum tensor can still be compatible with spacetime symmetries. The generalized hedgehog ansatz reduces Skyrme equations to coupled differential equations for two scalar fields with several constraint equations. The paper presents particular field configurations satisfying these constraints in various physically important spacetimes, including stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes.

This study represents a significant step towards understanding the mechanism driving convective flames in exploding white dwarfs. Key points from the abstract:1. The research uses a two-dimensional implicit hydrodynamical code to examine the propagation of the convective flame.2. Large-scale instabilities are captured by the grid, while smaller scales are approximated using a mixing length approximation.3. Large-scale perturbations (on the order of the pressure scale height) grow significantly during expansion, resulting in a non-spherical burning front.4. The combustion rate is initially enhanced compared to the unperturbed case but later suppressed by the star's expansion.5. This leads to only partial incineration of the nuclear fuel.6. The study concludes that large-scale perturbations alone are insufficient to explain the mechanism driving convective flames.7. It suggests that future research should examine the whole spectrum of relevant perturbations.8.
