Our approach only assumes the canonical scenario for structure formation from the collapse of overdense regions of the dark matter dominated primordial density field on progressively larger scales. The black hole accretion and merging rate have been maximized in the computation so as to obtain robust constraints on w and on its lookback time derivative wa. Our results provide independent constraints complementary to those obtained by combining supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryonic acoustic oscillations. While the latter concern combinations of w0 and wa, leaving the time evolution of the state parameter wa highly unconstrained, the BH abundance mainly provides upper limits on wa, only weakly depending on w0. Combined with the existing constraints, our results significantly restrict the allowed region in DDE parameter space, ruling out DDE models not providing cosmic time and fast growth factor large enough to allow for the building up of the observed abundance of BHs. In particular, models with 1/2 < w0 < 1 and positive redshift evolution wa > 0.8, completely consistent with previous constraints, are strongly disfavoured by our independent constraints from BH abundance. Such a range of parameters corresponds to quintom DDE models with w crossing -1 starting from larger values.\" The authors of this paper are C. Di Porto, Nicola Menci, A.

{"question_type": "single_entity_abstract_rephrased", "question": "Give me a broad introduction about 'the nonlinear evolution of massive stellar core collapses that fizzle'.", "method": "GraphCoT", "model_answer": "The paper titled 'the nonlinear evolution of massive stellar core collapses that fizzle' discusses the phenomenon of fizzled collapses in massive rotating stars. The abstract provides a detailed overview: \"Core collapse in a massive rotating star may pause before nuclear density is reached if the core contains total angular momentum j 1049 g cm2 s 1. In such aborted or fizzled collapses, temporary equilibrium objects form that, although rapidly rotating, are secularly and dynamically stable because of the high electron fraction per baryon ye 0 3 and the high entropy per baryon sb k 1 2 of the core material at neutrino trapping. These fizzled collapses are called fizzlers. In the absence of prolonged infall from the surrounding star, the evolution of fizzlers is driven by deleptonization, which causes them to contract and spin up until they either become stable neutron stars or reach the dynamic instability point for barlike modes. The barlike instability case is of current interest because the bars would be sources of gravitational wave (GW) radiation. In this paper, we use linear and nonlinear techniques, including three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, to study the behavior of fizzlers that have deleptonized to the point of reaching dynamic bar instability. The simulations show that the GW emission produced by bar-unstable fizzlers has rms strain amplitude r15h 10 23 to 10 22 for an observer on the rotation axis with wave frequency of roughly 60 600 Hz. Here, h is the strain, and r15 r 15 mpc is the distance to the fizzler in units of 15 mpc. If the bars that form by dynamic instability can maintain GW emission at this level for 100 periods or more, they may be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory at the distance of the Virgo cluster. They would be detectable as burst sources, defined as sources that persist for 10 cycles or less, if they occurred in the local group of galaxies. The long-term behavior of the bars is the crucial issue for the detection of fizzler events. The bars present at the end of our simulations are dynamically stable but will evolve on longer timescales because of a variety of effects such as shock heating, infall, deleptonization and cooling, as well as gravitational radiation and Newtonian gravitational coupling to surrounding material. Long-term simulations including these effects will be necessary to determine the ultimate fate and GW production of fizzlers with certainty.\" The authors of this paper are James N. Imamura, Brian K.

The occurrence of steady state squeezing is found to be highly sensitive to relaxation processes between the two photon resonant levels. For purely radiative decay from the upper level and no lower state relaxation, the population is susceptible to coherent population trapping near two photon resonance. The atom is optically pumped into a nonabsorbing trapped superposition state which, although it reduces upper level population, also leads to an interference cancellation of dipole moments and to suppression of squeezing. Lower level relaxation unbalances this interference and restores the squeezing to some extent. Transient squeezing is also predicted in the time dependent fluorescence.'

It also demonstrates that irrespective of the orientation of the rolls, the ramp always selects the wave number coinciding with the center of the Eckhaus band, which is well known in the one-dimensional case. Except for the above-mentioned case when the rolls are parallel to the ramp's slope, it is finally shown that under certain conditions, the one-dimensional configuration and those close to it may become unstable against infinitesimal disturbance with the wave vector perpendicular to the slope.", "duration": 37.7, "token_count": 24353, "api_calls": 14, "gt_answer": "N/A"}

It explores the behavior of particles with different Stokes numbers and finds that particles with small Stokes numbers behave similarly to the prediction of Saffman & Turner (1956), while those with very large Stokes numbers have collision frequencies similar to kinetic theory (Abrahamson, 1975). The paper also highlights the complex behavior of particles with intermediate Stokes numbers due to preferential concentration and particle decorrelation effects. The collision frequency is explained by considering the relationship between the collision frequency and two statistical properties of the particle phase: the radial distribution function and the relative velocity probability density function.", "duration": 9.92, "token_count": 9133, "api_calls": 6, "gt_answer": "N/A"}
