Di Porto, Nicola Menci, A. Lamastra, Luca Amendola, and Fabrizio Fiore was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2012. The research investigates dynamical dark energy (DDE) cosmologies by computing the number density of massive black holes at the centers of galaxies at redshift 6. The authors compare their computations with existing observational lower limits to derive constraints on the evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameter. Their approach assumes standard structure formation from the collapse of overdense regions in the dark matter-dominated primordial density field, while maximizing black hole accretion and merging rates to obtain robust constraints. The results provide independent constraints complementary to those from supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryonic acoustic oscillations, particularly limiting models with specific equation of state parameters and ruling out quintom DDE models where the parameter crosses -1 from larger values.", "duration": 59.36, "token_count": 31654, "api_calls": 16, "gt_answer": "N/A"}
